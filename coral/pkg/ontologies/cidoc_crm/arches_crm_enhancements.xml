<rdfs:Class rdf:about="E94_Space_Primitive">
    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Space</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises instances of E59 Primitive Value for space that should be implemented with appropriate validation, precision and references to spatial coordinate systems to express geometries on or relative to earth, or any other stable constellations of matter, relevant to cultural and scientific documentation.  
An E94 Space Primitive defines an E53 Place in the sense of a declarative place as elaborated in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013), which means that the identity of the place is derived from its geometric definition. This declarative place allows for the application of all place properties to relate phenomenal places to their approximations expressed with geometries.
Instances of E94 Space Primitive provide the ability to link CRM encoded data to the kinds of geometries used in maps or Geoinformation systems. They may be used for visualisation of the instances of E53 Place they define, in their geographic context and for computing topological relations between places based on these geometries.
E94 Space Primitive is not further elaborated upon within this model. Statement of compatibility with OPENGIS</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>This class comprises instances of E92 Spacetime Volume that result from intersection of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume with an instance of E52 Time-Span. The identity of an instance of this class is determined by the identities of the constituing spacetime volume and the time-span.</rdfs:comment>
